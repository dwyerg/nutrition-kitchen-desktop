            <p>
                We know how hard it can be to get started on a nutritious path, 
                which is why we decided to develop this website full of 
                resources that will aide in your transition to a healthier 
                lifestyle. Because there have been countless others before you 
                we have refined our craft to make it as accessible and easy for 
                you as possible. Please take your time looking around, there is 
                quite a lot to see and we don't want you to miss one bit of it.
            </p>
        <h2 class="sections line">Our Mission and Values</h2>
            <p>
                Mission: To simplify what it means to be healthy so this 
                lifestyle can be accessible to more people. Many people grew 
                up without little to no guidance when it comes to making 
                healthy choices. They were victims of their circumstance and we 
                want to rectify the overall situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Values: Unhealthy eating is systematic and problematic which 
                is why we are so passionate about the subject. For decades, 
                people have resigned themsleves to eating fast food thinking it 
                is the easiest and cheapest choice. And while they aren't 
                entirely incorrect, switching to a healthier lifestyle doesn't 
                necessarily mean a huge jump in the cost or accessiblity of food.
            </p>
        <h2 class="sections line">Our Founders</h2>
            <p>
                We have two main founders of the Nutrition Kitchen: the sisters 
                Crystal and Diamond Johnson. They grew up in a small town in 
                Michigan, eating mac and cheese on the daily. Once they moved 
                away to collge, they realized that their way of eating didn't 
                align with the healthiest choices. They both decided to major 
                in nutrition and upon graduation, they opened up their company:
                Nutrition Kitchen.
