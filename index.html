            Many people struggle to develop the habit of cooking every meal, 
            especially if they are college students. They find they don't have 
            enough time to prep and cook a meal, let alone all of the clean up 
            afterwards. We aspire to bring you easy recipes that you can throw 
            on the stove or in the oven and forget about it until you are 
            hungry. Many of our dishes are even advertised as being 3 bowls or 
            less, making it easy to throw all your dishes in one load of the 
            dishwasher. Additionally, we have have a section in our product 
            recomendations where we discuss several groups of spices you can use 
            on a daily basis without feeling like you've needed to spend 
            hundreds of dollars to make your food taste good.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eating healthy doesn't need to be a drag on your mental health or 
            on your wallet. We want you to do what's best for your body, while 
            on a reasonable budget. In many of our recipes we provide alternatives 
            if you are looking to keep things on the cheaper side.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, we want to aknowledge how difficult it can be to make the 
            transiton to cooking on the daily and focusing on your health. 
            It is encouraged for you to slowly ease into using our recipes and 
            transforming our shopping habbits. This can be especially hard if 
            you are strictly adhere to our products and recipes since they are 
            all gluten free and mostly vegetarian. These categoreies aren't 
            necessary for ultimate health but we know many people struggle with 
            dietary restictions and having these accomodations would be helpful 
            for many.
        </p>
