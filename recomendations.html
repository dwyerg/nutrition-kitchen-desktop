                This makes a great addition to any spice cabinet. You can add it to 
                anything and it saves you the hassle of having to mince garlic cloves 
                up. Similarly, adding onion powder to you regular rotation would be 
                an excellent idea as well. Both of these are staples in almost any 
                dish.

                <span id="cumin" class="reco_title">Cumin</span><br>
                Cumin is one spice you never want to run out of. Although it is not 
                commonly used for most people, we find that throwing it into most 
                savory dishes really accentuates the other flavors of the dish and 
                add a nice earthy overtone.

                <span id="nutmeg" class="reco_title">Nutmeg</span><br>
                On the opposite end of the spectrum is nutmeg, which is more classically 
                used in desserts or other sweet dishes. Add nutmeg to you oatmeal in 
                the morning or simply spice up a batch of cookies for an extra hint 
                of fall spices. Many people resort to cinnamon, but the flavor profile 
                with both spices makes for a nice warm treat.

                <span id="fruit" class="reco_title">Fruit</span><br>
                As any health nut will tell you, fruit is an excellent snack. It is 
                super low calorie and will satisfy any sweet tooth. We suggest you 
                always keep a bowl of fruit on the counter (or in the refridgerator 
                if you have fruit flies). You can populate it with apples, plums, 
                bananas and our personal favorite, avocados.

                <span class="reco_title">Pasta</span><br>
                Feeling like you don't have time to cook a complicated dish? Making 
                any sort of pasta is easy and fast. We recomend protein pasta, such
                as chickpea or lentil pasta, to boost the heartiness of the meal. You 
                can use multiple kinds of sauces to garnish: marinara, alfredo, pesto, 
                and so much more.

                In the morning, people often want a dish that is quick any easy to make. 
                We often say that smoothies are the best bet, you can even prepare them 
                the night before without much hassle. Throw in the fruit we mentioned 
                earlier, along with a decent helping of protein powder and you have 
                an extremely filling and healthy breakfast.

                <span id="tofu" class="reco_title">Firm Tofu</span><br>
                If you have a little more flex in your budget, we suggest picking up 
                a pack of firm tofu the next time you're at the grocery store. While 
                it does have a large amount of soy, the protein content is very high 
                as well. You can whip up tofu cubes easily in a well oiled plan or 
                in a newfangled air fryer.

                <span class="reco_title">Vegan Burger Patties</span><br>
                For those of you who prefer the meatier things in life, you can easily 
                use beef patties as well. However, because we are keeping things as 
                vegetarian, we bring up veggie patties as an excellent alterantive. You 
                don't even need to assmble a whole burger, just cut up the patty with 
                some ketchup and chow down. Plus, they're delicious!

                We know that it can be hard to eat cleanly all of the time, which is 
                why we are including ice cream on this list of products. Everything 
                is okay in moderation. We suggest a small scoop of vanilla ice cream 
                (non-dairy optional) with some blueberries or strawberries sprinkled 
                on top. Yum!!
